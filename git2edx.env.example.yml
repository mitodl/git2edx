# git2edx Example Configuration
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Modify this file and rename it to `git2edx.env.yml` to use!
#
# NOTE: To inform of the config location (this file), set the
#       `GIT2EDX_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.
# ANOTHER NOTE: This configuration takes precedence over corresponding
#               environment variables.

# CHANGE THIS to another random string! This is an optional GitHub webhook
#   secret, which is used to both a password to ensure that payloads are
#   coming from your repositories on GitHub, and to verify the integrity of the
#   payload. Secrets can also be configured at the course configuration level
#   (see the course configuration examples below).
#   NOTE: This can also be set using the `GIT2EDX_DEFAULT_SECRET` environment
#         variable.
default_secret: "Sdw_ZSJYIr2Go55U"
#   See GitHub's developer documentation for implementation details:
#   https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/#create-a-hook

# Studios are records of edX Studio locations and accounts that git2edx should
#   use during the Studio import stage. Course repositories are mapped to
#   studios using the "courses" configuration.
#   If this studio configuration is missing (or a configuration file can't be
#   found), git2edx will try to load the `url`, `email`, and `password` fields
#   from the following respective environment variables:
#     `GIT2EDX_STUDIO_URL`,
#     `GIT2EDX_STUDIO_EMAIL`, and
#     `GIT2EDX_STUDIO_PASSWORD`
studios:
  # The key name is used as a reference when mapping courses to studio
  #   configurations for course importing.
  edge:
    # The "url" should contain both the protocol (i.e., http or https) and, if
    #   not port 80, the port (e.g., the edX Developer Stack's default Studio
    #   port is 8001).
    url: "https://studio.edge.edx.org"
    email: "user@mit.edu"
    password: "pass"
    # Studio configurations marked with the "default" flag will be used for
    #   importing when an updated course repository has no corresponding course
    #   configuration.
    default: true
  devstack:
    url: "http://localhost:8001"
    email: "staff@example.com"
    password: "edx"

# The file system location used for checking out and storing course Git
#   repositories.
#   NOTE: This can also be set using the `GIT2EDX_COURSE_DIRECTORY` environment
#   variable.
course_directory: "courses"

# Courses are optional records of course Git repositories and mappings to Studio
#   configurations for deployment.
courses:
  # This key is used as the name of the file system directory within which the
  #   course repository is stored, and should always match exactly with the
  #   repository's name on GitHub.
  edx-demo-course:
    # These are the Studio configurations to use for importing when the
    #   repository triggers git2edx.

    # If the default secret is configured, this secret cascades over it. For
    #   more information about GitHub payload secrets, see the default secret
    #   example above. If you wish to use this, CHANGE THIS to another randomly
    #   generated string.
